1. Generics stop runtime errors ar compile time.
2. there is a concept of wildcard in generics that is signified using ?, its of three types:
    * Upper Bound List<? extends cls>
    * Lower Bound List<? super cls>
    * UnBound List<?>
3. List<? extends PersonList> needs to be done if the type is never to be referred like variable in method declarations
public void name(List<? extends parent> var name)
4. List<T extends ClassName> needs to be done if the type needs to be referred example
    static class Personholde<T extends Person>{
    T get()
    {



    }
    }
    if here we put ? in the class declaration then we cannot give a return type to the get method.
